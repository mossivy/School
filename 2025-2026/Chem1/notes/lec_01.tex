Molar Volume at STP is 22.4 $\frac{L}{mol}$ for any gas 
\vspace{0.2em}

Gas mixture is composed of He and $N_2$ and has pressure of 0.50 atm

Wht is the partial pressure of He if mole fraction is $N_2$ is 0.32

$P_{total} = P_{He} + P_{N_{2}}$ 
\[
\begin{cases}
    \text{KE} &= \frac{1}{2}\, m v^2 \\ 
    \text{KE} &= \frac{3}{2}\, \frac{R T}{N_2}
\end{cases}
\]
